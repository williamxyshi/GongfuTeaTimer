# GongfuTeaTimer
My submission for a simple and functional Gongfu Tea Timer as requested on the r/Tea subreddit

Gongfu brewing is a style of brewing which involves a larger ratio of tea leaves to water when compared to western brewing. Each successive brew requires slightly longer brew time and slightly higher brew temperature, as the leaves slowly become used up.
